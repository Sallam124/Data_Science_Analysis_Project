# Data_Science_Project
 
This project is a comprehensive data science workflow that combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. It focuses on understanding the data, uncovering patterns, and building models to make accurate predictions.

Key Features:
Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to identify trends and insights

Applied a range of predictive models, including linear and non-linear methods

Created APIs to automate data collection and enrich the dataset

Cleaned and processed real-world data for effective modeling

Developed visualizations to support data-driven understanding

Deployed an interactive prediction tool for user-friendly access

Gained practical experience in training, testing, and evaluating machine learning models

This project showcases a full cycle of a data science solution, from raw data exploration to real-time prediction.
