## Gaming Sales Prediction â€“ Data Science & EDA Project

This project explores global video game sales through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, with the goal of predicting the potential sales of an imaginary game based on various game features.

### Project Overview

Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle and enriched through web scraping from platforms like Steam and other gaming sources, this project analyzes patterns in game performance and builds models to estimate sales based on game attributes.

### Key Features

* Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover trends by genre, platform, and region
* Built multiple predictive models (Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and more)
* Created APIs to automate and enhance dataset quality through real-time data scraping
* Processed and cleaned data for accurate and reliable modeling
* Visualized key metrics like regional sales, critic/user scores, and publisher impact
* Deployed an interactive web app for users to simulate and predict game sales

### Dataset Features

* Game attributes: `Name`, `Platform`, `Genre`, `Publisher`, `Developer`, `Rating`
* Regional sales: `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`, `Global_Sales`
* Review metrics: `Critic_Score`, `User_Score`, `Critic_Count`, `User_Count`
* Target variable: `Global_Sales` (for predictive modeling)
